    "Hello there! My name is Sekar and I'm passionate about crafting engaging and dynamic digital experiences. My journey into the world of web development began in 2010 when I started tinkering with customizing WordPress themes - little did I know that this would ignite a passion for HTML and CSS that has carried me through my career.",
    "Since then, I've had the opportunity to work at various companies, from small start-ups to large corporations, and have honed my skills in front-end development and UX design. My current focus is on developing innovative and inclusive web products at a leading tech company.",
    "Outside of work, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others and have even created a popular online course that teaches students how to build web apps using cutting-edge technologies like React and GraphQL. I believe that the web has the power to bring people together and I'm excited to continue to be a part of that journey.",
